# Blog Client

This is a sample web application written in React and Redux.  It contains example uses of:
- Navigation with **[react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)**
- Input form state managed by **[redux-form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form)**
- Async HTTP request processing with **[redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)**

### Third-party API

The [Redux Blog Post API](http://reduxblog.herokuapp.com/) is provides the data fetched by the app.

All requests do require a key, but it is generated by the caller and used to namespace the blog post data between users of the API.

To configure the application to build, create a JSON file named **`env.json`** in the root directory with the following content and replace the `<placeholder>` with your generated key:
```
{
  "BLOG_API_KEY": "<some unique value>",
}
```

### Running locally

Once you have created the **`env.json`** file you can build and run locally with the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```
### S3 Hosting

The **`deploy-to-aws-s3.sh`** script builds the web resources and assets then pushes them to an S3 bucket setup for web hosting.

AWS S3 must be [configured](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html) to host the content before running the deploy script.

### Special Thanks

This sample application was made possible thanks to [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/StephenGrider), his hosted [blog API](http://reduxblog.herokuapp.com/), and his React and Redux course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/).
